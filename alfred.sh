NAME:
$(basename $0)

USAGE: 
$(basename $0) [option] <source> <destination> [search_text] 

DESCRIPTION:
This script compiles a directory of .less files and outputs a directory of .css files. You can search text within the file to filter which less files to compile.

OPTIONS
  -h, --help	Print help (this message) and exit.

EXAMPLES
$(basename $0) ~/theme/less ~/theme/css
This the most basic version. It takes all of the less files and compiles them as css.

$(basename $0) ~/theme/less ~/theme/css '.theme()'
This again takes all of the less files with the text '.theme()' in them and compiles them to css.

PREREQUISITES
Less compiler needs to be installed. See http://lesscss.org for more information.

# Alfred

## Installation
Put the shell script in the location of your choice. You may want it readily available in /home/[your username]/bin or possibly in /usr/local/bin for all users.

Once there, you need to make it executable by running the following command:
`chmod +x alfred`

## Usage
alfred [option] <source> <destination> [search_text] 

## Description
This script compiles a directory of .less files and outputs a directory of .css files. You can search text within the file to filter which less files to compile.

## Options
  -h, --help	Print help (this message) and exit.

## Examples
`alfred ~/theme/less ~/theme/css`
This the most basic version. It takes all of the less files and compiles them as css.

`alfred ~/theme/less ~/theme/css '.theme()'`
This again takes all of the less files with the text '.theme()' in them and compiles them to css.

## Prerequisites
Less compiler needs to be installed. See http://lesscss.org for more information.
